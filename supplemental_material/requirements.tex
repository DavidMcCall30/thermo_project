\section*{Computer Requirements}

We will be running calculations in the palmetto account. Look to your project notes for copying files over from the desktop onto the scratch nodes, running programs interactively, and next you will run a simple model of code via the thermonuclear project files on canvas. Then you will start doing your project specific code calculations. 


%\hspace{12ex}The calculations needed to create the figures can be run on most 
%computers.  It is necessary to install the appropriate libraries, as described 
%at \url{http://sourceforge.net/p/nucnet-projects/wiki/libraries/}.
%Since the input and 
%output XML data are parsed in with a DOM parser, it is advisable to have at 
%least 2 Gb of RAM.
